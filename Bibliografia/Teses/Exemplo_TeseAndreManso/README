This set of files provide a template for using LaTeX to write a Master
or PhD thesis according to the IST regulations.

The main file is 'Thesis.tex' and it includes all the other .tex files
in the ZIP package:

	Thesis.TeX
		Thesis_Preamble.tex
		Thesis_FrontCover.tex
		Thesis_Dedication.tex
		Thesis_Acknowledgements.tex
		Thesis_Resumo.tex
		Thesis_Abstract.tex
		Thesis_Nomenclature.tex
		Thesis_Glossary.tex
		Thesis_Introduction.tex
		Thesis_Implementation.tex
		Thesis_<new chapters>.tex
		Thesis_Results.tex
		Thesis_Conclusions.tex
		Thesis_Appendix_A.tex
		Thesis_Appendix_B.tex
		Thesis_bib_DB.bib
		abbrvunsrtnat.bst
		glossary.sty
		IST_A_CMYK_POS.pdf		
		Makefile

It is not required that you are familiar with LaTeX since the files
should be quite self explanatory.
Please be sure you understand the structure before you start editing.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Just use the make file 'Makefile' to process the LaTeX code and output
the PDF file.
Under Linux, this means typing 'make' at the terminal prompt.

To run LaTeX on Windows, it is required to install additional software,
if it has not been done before.

The instructions below are just two possible solutions, but they proved
robust during tests.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
a) Software download

i) compiler:
MiKTeX 2.9 (or later)
Download from http://miktex.org/2.9/setup

This version appears to be quite stable. Search for more recent releases
if available.

ii) text editor:

Choose one of the two editors below. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TeX_editors for helping you choose.

Option 1: Texmaker 4.4.1 (or later)
Download from http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html

This editor is nice because it allows two windows,
showing both the source code and the compiled pdf, simultaneously.
It also automatically installs and updates any necessary LaTeX package.

Option 2: TeXstudio 2.9.4 (or later)
Download from http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/

this editor also provides modern writing support, such as interactive spell checking, code folding, and syntax highlighting.
It is an extended version of the previous one with additional features while keeping its look and feel.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
b) Installation notes

i) Compiler
------------------------
>>> MiKTeX
First install this compiler. Just follow the on screen instructions.

Accept the default directory paths so that Texmaker can automatically
find the required executables for compilation (pdflatex, makeindex,
bibtex, etc).

ii) text editor:
------------------------

After the compiler is installed, the TeX editor can then be installed.
Follow the on screen instructions.

After installation, it is necessary to configure the compilation
commands and, optionally, define shortcuts.

>>> a) Texmaker

Texmaker -> Options (menu bar) -> Configure Texmaker ->
Compile (left menu) -> User

Add the following commands without line breaks (this replicates the makefile used in Linux):

pdflatex %.tex | 
makeindex %.glo -s %.ist -t %.glg -o %.gls | 
makeindex %.nlo -s nomencl.ist -o %.nls | 
bibtex %.aux | 
pdflatex -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode %.tex | 
pdflatex -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode %.tex

The last command is optional and depends on the version of Acrobat
Reader installed.
If it is not installed, download it from http://get.adobe.com/reader/

>>> b) TeXstudio

TeXstudio -> Options (menu bar) -> Configure TeXstudio ->
Build (left menu) -> User Commands

Press "+Add"
Rename command from "user0:" to "THESIS"
Add the following commands without line breaks (this replicates the makefile used in Linux):

pdflatex.exe -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode %.tex | 
makeindex %.glo -s %.ist -t %.glg -o %.gls | 
makeindex %.nlo -s nomencl.ist -o %.nls | 
bibtex.exe % | 
pdflatex.exe -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode %.tex | 
pdflatex.exe -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode %.tex

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
c) Compile LaTeX source

>>> a) Texmaker

To compile, just click on the blue arrow next to "Compile", making sure the main TeX source is open.

To compile from any open file, the compilation commands have to be edited, replacing % by the main file name.

>>> b) TeXstudio

To compile, just select Tools (menu bar) -> User -> THESIS:, making sure the main TeX source is open.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
d) Define shortcuts (optional)

It is possible to program shortcuts.
It is advisable to assign the function keys Fx to the "compile", "clean" and "see pdf" functions.

>>> a) Texmaker

>>> b) TeXstudio

TeXstudio -> Options (menu bar) -> Configure TeXstudio ->
Shortcuts (left menu)

Menu -> Tools -> User
1:THESIS
edit Current Shortcut F5

Now to compile the entire document, just press F5
