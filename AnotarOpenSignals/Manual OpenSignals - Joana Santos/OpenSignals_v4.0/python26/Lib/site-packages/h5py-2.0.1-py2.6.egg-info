Description: 
        The h5py package provides both a high- and low-level interface to the HDF5
        library from Python. The low-level interface is intended to be a complete
        wrapping of the HDF5 API, while the high-level component supports  access to
        HDF5 files, datasets and groups using established Python and NumPy concepts.
        
        A strong emphasis on automatic conversion between Python (Numpy) datatypes and
        data structures and their HDF5 equivalents vastly simplifies the process of
        reading and writing data from Python.
        
        Supports HDF5 versions 1.8.2 and higher.  On Windows, HDF5 is included with
        the installer.
